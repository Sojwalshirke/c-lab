This program demonstrates exception handling in C++ to manage division by zero errors.
It includes a divide function that throws an exception if the denominator is zero. 
The main function uses a try-catch block to handle the exception and display an appropriate error message.
Input is taken from the user for the numerator and denominator, and the result is computed safely. This ensures robust error management during runtime.
